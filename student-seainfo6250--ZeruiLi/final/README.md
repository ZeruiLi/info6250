# SpendSmart

## Project Overview
SpendSmart is an efficient financial management software designed to help users effectively manage their personal finances. By setting a budget and recording every expense, users can clearly understand their financial situation, including total expenditures and remaining budget. Additionally, the software automatically generates tables and calculates the remaining budget in real-time, making financial management straightforward and clear.

## Key Features
- **Set Budget**: Users can enter a total budget amount as the baseline for financial management.
- **Add Expense Items**: Users can add new expense items whenever there is a new expenditure, including the amount spent and the category.
- **Delete Expense Items**: Users can delete incorrect or unnecessary expense records at any time.
- **Modify Budget**: Adjust the budget at any time to accommodate changing financial needs.
- **Automatic Calculations**: The software automatically calculates and updates the remaining budget and total expenditures.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Uses the Express framework to handle backend logic and data management.
